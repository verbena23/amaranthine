Amaranthine a dark tone theme for Openbox based on purple and dark grey.

A system wide theme including colours for openbox, Gtk3 and 2, Tint2, conky, Dunst and Rofi. 

This is my first attempt at a complete system wide integrated theme, so please excuse any hiccups.

My system is a bit of a mess at the minute as it is based upon KDE Neon which relies heavily upon Qt. I was happy with KDE but was having some problems with it hanging and being a bit slow in places. I wanted to swap out the distro for Manjaro, but somehow during an update a couple of months ago something called Moki manager was foisted upon me.

I wasn't really sure what it was at the time and I have a funny feeling that a password was requested which for the life of me I cannot remember (probably being a bit worse for wear at the time) and as such I find myself locked out of my own BIOS, unable to change main distro and only able to change DE. This is a pain because Openbox offers limited support for QT theming and so I have had to add extra GTK programmes and libraries to replace some of the default KDE programmes as they just look awful in Openbox.I've tried to get around this , but unfortunately this is beyond my paygrade at the minute, so any hints would be much appreciated.


Anyway for what it's worth-

git account


anything else?????




Like I sais this is the first time I've attempte this and used an Imgur* or Git account, so if anything is missing or, of course, if any other constructive criticism could be offered it would be greatly appreciated.


Pretty pissed off that i had to open a Google account just to get on to Imgur (even though it's in a fake name. I really didn't want to let Google on my machine- is this normal? It kept returning a 403 error when trying to open with a third party email account).
